        <div class="que">
            <h2>2. What is a Bootstrap Container, and how does it work ?</h2>
            <p>Containers are the most basic layout element in Bootstrap and are required when using our default grid
                system. Containers are used to contain, pad, and (sometimes) center the content within them. While
                containers can be nested, most layouts do not require a nested container.</p>
            <p>Bootstrap comes with three different containers :-</p>
            <ul>
                <li><b style="color: black;">.container,</b>which sets a <b style="color: black;">max-width</b> at each
                    responsive breakpoint.</li>
                <li><b style="color: black;">.container-fluid, </b>Which is <b style="color: black;">width: 100%</b> at
                    all breakpoints.</li>
                <li><b style="color: black;">.container-{breakpoint},</b>Which is <b style="color: black;"> width: 100%
                    </b>until the specified breakpoint</li>
            </ul>
            <p>In other words, we can say that containers are established the width for the layout to give the content.
                Elements and content are added within the container.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="que">
            <h2>3. What are the default Bootstrap text settings ?</h2>
            <p>Bootstrap 4 Default Settings :-</p>
            <p>Bootstrap 4 uses a default font-size of 16px, and its line-height is 1.5. The default font-family is
                "Helvetica Neue", Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif. In addition, all
            <p> elements have margin-top: 0 and margin-bottom: 1rem (16px by default).</p>
        </div>
        <div class="que">
            <h2>4. What do you know about the Bootstrap Grid System ?</h2>
            <p>Bootstrap's grid system uses a series of containers, rows, and columns to layout and align content. It's
                built with flexbox and is fully responsive. Below is an example and an in-depth look at how the grid
                comes together.</p>
            <p>It is a powerful mobile-first flexbox grid to build layouts of all shapes and sizes thanks to a
                <span style="color: black; text-decoration: underline;">twelve column system, six default responsive
                    tiers, Sass variables and mixins,</span>and
                <span style="color: black; text-decoration: underline;">dozens of predefined classes.</span>
            </p>
            <p>There are 6 classes in Bootstrap 5 grid system :-</p>
            <ul>
                <li>.col- (extra small devices - screen width less than 576px)</li>
                <li>.col-sm- (small devices - screen width equal to or greater than 576px)</li>
                <li>.col-md- (medium devices - screen width equal to or greater than 768px)</li>
                <li>.col-lg- (large devices - screen width equal to or greater than 992px)</li>
                <li>.col-xl- (extra large devices - screen width equal to or greater than 1200px)</li>
                <li>.col-xxl- (extra extra large devices - screen width equal to or greater than 1400px)</li>
            </ul>
            <p>You can also combine the above classes to create more dynamic and flexible layouts.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="que">
            <h2>5. What is the difference between Bootstrap 4 and Bootstrap 5.</h2>
            <p>The form elements in Bootstrap 4 have defaulted to the browser-provided view. However, in Bootstrap 5,
                the form elements have a custom design that enables them to have a consistent look and feel in all
                browsers. The new form controls are based on completely semantic, standard form controls.</p>
            <p>It is an open-source framework from late 2011 that is used for designing responsive websites with a
                mobile-first approach faster and easier. Bootstrap is available for HTML, CSS, and JS. According to
                server-side languages like PHP, Node, etc. bootstrap helps to design the frontend. Bootstrap has made
                the work for developers easier by making the templates ready which are basic part of every website. Thus
                people tend to develop further and don’t waste time on basic templates with beautiful designs along with
                responsiveness available. </p>
            <p>Why Bootstrap? </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Faster and Easier</li>
                <li>Mobile First style</li>
                <li>It is free! Available on <b
                        style="color: black; text-decoration: underline;">www.getbootstrap.com</b></li>
                <li>Browser support</li>
                <li>Responsive Design</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Bootstrap 5 alpha launched in mid-June of 2020. As it is in the alpha-1 version, in the future some more
                features can be added to bootstrap 5</p>
            <p style="color: black;">In the alpha-1 version of bootstrap 5 some classes removed are :- </p>

            <p>Button groups allow multiple buttons to be stacked together on a single line. This is useful when you
                want to place items like alignment buttons together. You can add on optional JavaScript radio and
                checkbox style behavior with Bootstrap Button Plugin. This class is used for a basic button group.</p>
            <p>“Button Groups” in Bootstrap is used to create series of buttons in groups (without spaces) vertically or
                horizontally.</p>
            <p>The class name of basic Button Group is “.btn-group” which is the basic syntax of the button group class
                where each button has its own class of “btn”.</p>

            <h2>8. In Bootstrap 4, what is flexbox?</h2>
            <p>Flexbox. The biggest difference between Bootstrap 3 and Bootstrap 4 is that Bootstrap 4 now uses flexbox,
                instead of floats, to handle the layout. The Flexible Box Layout Module, makes it easier to design
                flexible responsive layout structure without using float or positioning.</p>
            <p>In Bootstrap 4, flex box is used to control the layout and alignment specification of Bootstrap 4
                components. This box makes it easier to design flexible responsive layout structures without using float
                or positioning attributes.</p>
            <p>Flex utility can be used to manage the layout, alignment, grid columns, navigation and other components
                of the page. It makes easy to design layout structure without using float or positioning.</p>
            <p>Flex Behaviors and Direction</p>
            <p>Use the flexbox display utilities like d-flex and d-inline-flex to display the flexbox container and
                children elements into flex items. You can set the direction of flex items in horizontal direction and
                vertical direction by using .flex-row (use .flex-row-reverse to display horizontal direction from the
                opposite side) and .flex-column (use .flex-column-reverse to display vertical direction from the
                opposite side) classes.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Justify Content :- (such as start, end, center, between and around)</li>
                <li>Align Items :- (such as start, end, center, baseline and stretch)</li>
                <li>Fill, Grow and Shrink :- .flex-fill, .flex-grow-* & .flex-shrink</li>
                <li>Auto Margins and With align-items :- .mr-auto (pushes items to the right) and .ml-auto (pushes items
                    to the left) classes. The flex items can be moved to top or bottom by using mt-auto or mb-auto
                    classes on a container.</li>
                <li>Order :- The flex uses order utilities to change the order of flex items in a container.</li>
                <li>Align Content :- (such as start, end, center, between and around)</li>

            <p>A bootstrap card is a flexible and extensible content container. It includes options for headers and
                footers, a wide variety of content, contextual background colors, and powerful display options.</p>
            <p>cards are built with as little markup and styles as possible, but still manage to deliver a ton of
                control and customization. Built with flexbox, they offer easy alignment and mix well with other
                Bootstrap components. They have no margin by default, so use spacing utilities as needed.</p>
            <p>Cards support a wide variety of content, including images, text, list groups, links, and more.</p>
            <ul>
